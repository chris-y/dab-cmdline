#define	BASE_PORT	8765
#define	PACKET_SIZE	32

//	The radio will react on commands
//	The commands consist of a package with two components
//	the command identifier and a 0-terminated asci string
//
//	e.g. Q_GAIN "70" or Q_CHANNEL "11C"
#define Q_QUIT		0100
#define Q_GAIN		0101
#define Q_CHANNEL       0102
#define Q_SERVICE       0103

//	The radio will send some data back through port + 1
//	in all cases the format of the message is
//	a one byte identifier followed by a 0-terminated string
